### AWS IAM(Identity Access Management) OVERVIEW

1. What is IAM?
- is a permission system that regulates access to AWS resources
- assigns permission to groups of users
- monitors or audits access to resources using AWS CloudTrail
- integrates with other Identity Tech (Microsoft ActiveDirectory)

2. How IAM works

- 4 key concepts: Users Groups, Roles, and Policies/Permissions
- Users: Specific individuals, can receive personal logins
- Groups: Collection of users
- Roles: Collection of policies (DB Read, DB Write)
- Policies: Low level permission to resources (Allow or Deny)
